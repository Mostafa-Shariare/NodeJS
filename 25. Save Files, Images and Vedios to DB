### 🔧 What This Code Is Doing (High-Level View):

1. **Multer** handles file uploads (stores them in a local folder: `/uploads`).
2. The file’s name is saved in MongoDB using Mongoose (not the file itself).
3. Your `User` model stores:
   - `name` (string)
   - `image` (string - the filename of the uploaded image)

---

### 📁 Where Is the File Stored?

- The actual **file** (image) is stored on your **server** under the `/uploads` folder.
- In MongoDB, only the **filename** (`image`) is stored.

**Example MongoDB document:**
```json
{
  "_id": "someId",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "image": "1713639948745-profile.jpg"
}
```

So, when you want to display the image later in frontend, you can serve it using Express like:

```js
app.use('/uploads', express.static('uploads'));
```

Then access it at:  
`http://localhost:3000/uploads/1713639948745-profile.jpg`

### 📹 What If You Want to Store Videos Too?

You just update your HTML form to allow video uploads, and maybe extend the schema like this:

```js
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    image: String,   // for image files
    video: String    // for video files
});
```

Then in your route, change `upload.single('image')` to `upload.fields(...)`:

```js
app.post('/register', upload.fields([
    { name: 'image', maxCount: 1 },
    { name: 'video', maxCount: 1 }
]), async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const newUser = new User({
            name: req.body.name,
            image: req.files['image'][0].filename,
            video: req.files['video'][0].filename
        });
        await newUser.save();
        res.status(200).send('User with image and video registered!');
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(err);
        res.status(500).send("Something went wrong");
    }
});
```

### 💾 What If You Want to Save the File **Inside MongoDB**?

You’d use `Buffer` and store the file as binary (not filename). Here’s a small change:

```js
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    image: {
        data: Buffer,
        contentType: String
    }
});
```

And in your route:

```js
app.post('/register', upload.single('image'), async (req, res) => {
    const fs = require('fs');
    const img = fs.readFileSync(req.file.path);

    const newUser = new User({
        name: req.body.name,
        image: {
            data: img,
            contentType: req.file.mimetype
        }
    });

    await newUser.save();
    res.send("Image stored directly in MongoDB");
});
```

> But note: storing large files in MongoDB isn't always recommended — especially videos. Use **GridFS** for large files, or store them in the file system / cloud (e.g. AWS S3) and just keep the reference in MongoDB.

### 💡 Summary of Ways to Save File:

| Method                         | Where File Stored?         | MongoDB Stores?             |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `multer + local folder`       | Server (`/uploads`)         | Just file name              |
| `multer + buffer`             | In MongoDB (as binary)      | File content & type         |
| `multer + GridFS`             | MongoDB (for large files)   | File stream chunks          |
| `multer + cloud (e.g. S3)`    | AWS S3/Cloudinary/etc       | Just cloud URL              |
